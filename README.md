# Taco Adventure Project

This is an app for taco and beer lovers, with the click of a button they get the name of a random taco and the name of a random beer as a suggested combo. If the user likes the combo then the user can save it to their favorites in local storage. This is a group project that was created as a homework assignment for the OSU coding bootcamp.
